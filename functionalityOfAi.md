# ðŸ¤– Types of Artificial Intelligence Based on Functionality

AI systems can be classified into four distinct types based on how they function and simulate human cognitive abilities. These categories define the **depth of intelligence** and **capability** embedded in each system.

## 1. Reactive Machines

### Definition
Reactive machines are the **most basic form of AI**. They can only **respond to current inputs** using pre-programmed rules. They **do not store memories** or use past experiences to influence future decisions.

### Characteristics
- No memory or data retention
- Task-specific responses
- Cannot learn from past actions

### Examples
- **IBMâ€™s Deep Blue** (chess-playing AI)
- Basic image recognition tools
- Spam email classifiers (basic rule-based)

### Use Cases
- Game-playing bots (Chess, Go)
- Basic industrial robots
- Rule-based sorting systems
- Optical character recognition (OCR)

## 2. Limited Memory

### Definition
Limited Memory AI systems can **look into the past** and use **previous data or observations** to make decisions. Most **modern AI models** fall into this category.

### Characteristics
- Stores short-term memory for recent data
- Continuously updates its model from new input
- Learns from historical data

### Examples
- **Self-driving cars** (observe lane markings, traffic, speed)
- **ChatGPT** (remembers recent prompts in a conversation)
- Image classifiers trained over datasets
- Voice assistants with personalization

### Use Cases
- Autonomous vehicles
- Virtual assistants with user customization
- Financial trading bots
- Predictive text keyboards

## 3. Theory of Mind

### Definition
Theory of Mind AI refers to systems that **understand human emotions, beliefs, and intentions**. This type of AI is still **under development** and aims to interpret mental states for better interaction.

### Characteristics
- Models human thoughts and emotions
- Adapts behavior based on social context
- Requires advanced cognitive modeling

### Examples
- No real-world implementation yet
- Some research in **social robotics** and **emotion-recognizing AI**

### Potential Use Cases
- Emotionally intelligent companions
- Human-robot collaboration in caregiving
- Empathetic virtual therapists
- AI in education that adapts to student emotions

## 4. Self-Aware AI

### Definition
Self-Aware AI is the **most advanced and hypothetical** form of AI. It will have its **own consciousness, self-awareness, and emotions**. This level of AI is **not yet achieved**.

### Characteristics
- Has a sense of self
- Understands its own internal states
- Can make autonomous decisions based on introspection

### Examples
- No known implementations; purely theoretical

### Potential Use Cases
- True human-like robots
- Fully autonomous decision-makers
- Philosophical and ethical AI interactions
- Independent scientific reasoning systems
