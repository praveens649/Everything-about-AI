## 1. Evolution of AI Based on Timeline

AI has evolved over several decades, each marked by breakthroughs in theory, hardware, and application.

### Timeline of AI Development

#### ðŸ”¹ 1950s: The Birth of AI
- Alan Turing proposes the **Turing Test**
- John McCarthy coins the term **Artificial Intelligence**
- Early work in symbolic reasoning and problem solving

#### ðŸ”¹ 1960sâ€“1970s: Rule-Based Systems
- Development of **ELIZA** (natural language processing)
- Emergence of **expert systems** using "if-then" rules
- Limited success due to rigid logic and lack of learning

#### ðŸ”¹ 1980s: Rise of Expert Systems
- AI used in business and medicine (e.g., MYCIN)
- Knowledge-based systems gain popularity
- Performance limited by lack of real-world knowledge

#### ðŸ”¹ 1990s: Machine Learning Era Begins
- IBM's **Deep Blue** defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov
- Emergence of **support vector machines** and **decision trees**
- Focus shifts from programming logic to learning from data

#### ðŸ”¹ 2000s: Data-Driven AI
- Growth of the internet enables **big data**
- Advancements in **supervised and unsupervised learning**
- AI used in spam filtering, fraud detection, etc.

#### ðŸ”¹ 2010s: Deep Learning Revolution
- Introduction of **deep neural networks**
- Breakthroughs in computer vision, NLP, and speech recognition
- Landmark: **AlphaGo** defeats world Go champion
- Rise of personal assistants, self-driving car prototypes

#### ðŸ”¹ 2020sâ€“Present: Generative & Generalizing AI
- Emergence of **Generative AI** (e.g., GPT, DALLÂ·E, Midjourney)
- Advancements in **transformer architecture**
- Increased focus on **AI safety**, **alignment**, and **regulations**
- Growing interest in **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
